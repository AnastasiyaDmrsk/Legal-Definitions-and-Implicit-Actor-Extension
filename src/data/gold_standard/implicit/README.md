":", enumerations like "(a)" and enumeration introductions "the following tasks", "all of the following information:", "the following third countries", " one of the following applies", "any of the following", "the following information:", "one of the following grounds applies:", "either:" and "the following" were deleted, exception: phrase "on the following grounds:", the ":" was kept

	";" viewed/changed to "."
	
column "implict actor present": y=yes; n=actor present or actor missing but its a statement sentence where no "by" clause can be added; i= informative sentence/statement (= no actor but also not necessary e.g. info what should be contained in a contract)
	
Implicit Actor inclusion in sentence: included after the identified verb with "by" - e.g. by the Commission
	
Blacklist verbs: related, referred, based on --> "n" (no implicit actor, because no actor is needed)
